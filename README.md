# Drone-3D-Feedback-Control-System-Development-Project（Conda）
As a core developer of this project, I was responsible for designing and testing the multi-axis PID-based drone position control algorithm. 
							  By incorporating differential filtering, integral clamping, and fifth-order trajectory planning, 
							  I optimized the steady-state error to 0.12m and reduced overshoot by 42%. Currently, I am proposing future optimizations and continuous improvements, 
							  including:   
							  (1) Developing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) module to enhance adaptability in dynamic environments;   
							  (2) Implementing reinforcement learning-based parameter auto-tuning 
							  to reduce manual tuning efforts;   
							  (3) Building wind disturbance and sensor noise models in a simulation environment to validate algorithm robustness. Through this project, 
							  I further enhanced my expertise in drone dynamics modeling, multivariable control optimization, and Python-based real-time system development.
